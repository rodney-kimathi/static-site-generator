        <h1>Frontend Development is the Worst</h1>
        <p>
            Look, front-end development is for script kiddies and soydevs who can't handle real 
            programming. I mean, it's just a bunch of divs and spans, right? And CSS??? It's like, 
            "Oh, I want this to be red, but not thaaaaat red." What a joke.
        </p>
        <p>
            Real programmers code, not silly markup languages. They code on Arch Linux, not macOS, 
            and certainly not Windows. They use Vim, not VS Code. They use C, not HTML. Come to the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend">backend</a>, where real 
            programming happens.
